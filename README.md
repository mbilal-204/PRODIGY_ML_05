Task-05
Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101

Project includes : 
Data Handling and Preprocessing: Downloads the Food-101 dataset, preprocesses images, splits them into training and testing sets, and creates subsets for experimentation.

Model Building: Implements and fine-tunes pretrained models like ResNet50 and InceptionV3 for food classification tasks, utilizing techniques such as transfer learning and regularization.

Training and Evaluation: Trains models on the prepared data, evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy and loss, and visualizes training/validation metrics over epochs.

Prediction: Uses trained models to make predictions on new images and visualizes the results.
